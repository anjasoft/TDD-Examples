# TDD-Examples

This repository contains two examples used in a TDD-meetup: a simple PasswordValidator and a little more complicated ProductApplication.

Both projects contains (at least) a test project and a project under test. The test-class and the class under test contains a bunch of commented out chunks of code, marked with "Iteration 1", "Iteration 2" ... "Iteration n".
This is to show the flow from writing a simple, naive test and implementing code to make that pass, adding more tests and implementing+refactoring as you go. Just remember to only have one chunk uncommented at a time and it should work out ok.
